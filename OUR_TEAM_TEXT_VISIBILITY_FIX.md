# "Our Team" Text Visibility Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Issue Identified
The "Our Team" heading and description text were not visible on the page due to poor color contrast. The text was using dark colors (`text-gray-900` and `text-gray-600`) against a dark background, making it effectively invisible to users.

## 🔧 Root Cause
In the TeamSection component, the text colors were:
- **Heading**: `text-gray-900` (very dark gray/black)
- **Description**: `text-gray-600` (medium dark gray)
- **Call-to-action**: `text-gray-600` (medium dark gray)

These dark colors were not visible against the dark theme background of the website.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Updated Text Colors** (`src/components/home/TeamSection.tsx`)

// After:
<h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-3 sm:mb-4">

</h2>
```

#### **Description Text:**
```tsx
